# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

The Python TensorFlow library was used to split and train data to analyze a dataset of charities and determine which ones were going to be most successful using donated funds.

## Results

Due to the objective of the model, the target variable in this case is "IS_SUCCESSFUL". Variables that were considered features were every other variable except for "EIN" and "NAME", which was dropped due to irrelevance to the models overall performance.
